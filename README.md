## Deploy a Flask app on AWS step by step
- Please allow HTTP traffic in your EC2 instance
# 1. Install and update the required packages
Connect by SSH to your EC2 instance and run the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
```

Install the Python Virtual Environment package

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-venv
```

# 2. Clone your GitHub project and set up the virtual environment

In my case I'm cloning a project called "Flask-tutorial"
```bash
git clone 
```
